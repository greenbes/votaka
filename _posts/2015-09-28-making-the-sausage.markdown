Let's get this out of the way: _I don't know the answer_ but I have
felt the pain of the problem.  I spend a lot of time in online
meetings and working with distributed teams.  Decisions aren't
captured, notes aren't distributed, context is lost. People don't want
to be locked to a single service.  Not everyone agrees on the client.

The purpose of this blog is to document the process of figuring it
out.  Watch me make the sausage.  Heck, you can even suggest a recipe.

On this site you can expect to see:

* Product feature ideas
* Results from user interviews or surveys
* Background research and information on related products
* Stupid jokes

Eventually, I hope to have:

* A solid picture of the customer
* Concrete feature requirements
* Design
* Funnier jokes

Mostly, you'll watch me struggle with the questions and try to think
things through.  You're welcome to ride along and see the sights.

Many of these ideas will be bad.  In the full light of day, some will
turn out to be _very_ bad.  There are dead ends, blind corners, and
the pit of despair.  It'll be fun!  You can send email telling me how
bad my ideas are.  I love getting mail.
